## Common gotchas

While lessons are thoughtfully designed to facilitate learning, there are some common pitfalls or challenges that a learner might face. These will be described after the script for each lesson. These will be described after the script for each lesson.

## Knowledge check

Each lesson contains a brief self-assessment quiz designed to gauge learners' comprehension and retention of the video material. These assessments reinforce key concepts and help learners self-assess their understanding. These assessments reinforce key concepts and help learners self-assess their understanding.

The quiz section has two components, questions and answers. The questions contain lesson-applicable questions and the answers contain the corresponding answers. The questions contain lesson-applicable questions and the answers contain the corresponding answers.

Since this is a self assessment, you can of course skip the questions and go straight to the answers; but, we strongly recommend that you take the time to solve the question on your own before checking the answer.

### Runnable Chialisp and clvm plugins

Runnable plugins are for Chialisp and clvm are provided with all applicable lessons. Runnable plugins are for Chialisp and clvm are provided with all applicable lessons. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the tools and learn how to best make use of them throughout the lessons.  
Each plugin has a series of components:

**Language:** The language of the plugin (Chialisp or clvm) is in the top right corner.  
**Solution:** The top section is the input or solution.  
**Puzzle:** The bottom section is the puzzle.  
**Run:** Each plugin has a play/run button to the right of the language identifier.  
**Result:** After clicking run, the result of the puzzle appears below the puzzle.  
**Cost:** After clicking run, the clvm cost of the puzzle is calculated and appears in the bottom right corner.  
**Errors:** After clicking run, the plugin checks for and provides any errors in place of the result section.

:::info

The plugins only validate the formatting and completeness of the code; they do not check for any potential exploits.

#### Chialisp plugin

When clicking run, the puzzle will first be serialized into clvm (similar to the `run` command) then the solution will be passed into the serialized puzzle (similar to the `brun` command).  
The below example is a Chialisp puzzle that squares the number passed as an argument.

Note the number `(5)` is used in the solution top section and the Chialisp formatted puzzle is entered in the puzzle bottom section. Clicking run on this puzzle will return `25` as the result. Clicking run on this puzzle will return `25` as the result.

<Runnable flavor='chialisp' input='(5)'>

```chialisp
(mod (arg)
    (defun square (number)
        (* number number)
    )
    (square arg)
)
```

</Runnable>

#### Clvm plugin

When clicking run, the solution will be passed into the serialized puzzle (similar to the `brun` command).  
The below example uses the serialized puzzle from above that squares the number passed as an argument.

Note the number `(5)` is used in the solution top section and the serialized puzzle is entered in the puzzle bottom section. Clicking run on this puzzle will return `25` as the result. Clicking run on this puzzle will return `25` as the result.

<Runnable flavor='clvm' input='(5)'>

```chialisp
(a (q 2 2 (c 2 (c 5 ()))) (c (q 18 5 5) 1))
```

</Runnable>
